## Research Interests

Induced seismicity

Lithospheric Structure of Southeastern Tibet

## Research Experiences
***Shear wave velocity and attenuation imaging of the lithosphere in southeastern Tibet.***

Utilize Two Plane Wave method to invert Rayleigh wave phase velocity and attenuation coefficient simultaneously for 4 subregions in SE Tibet. It’s a rare attempt to apply two plane wave method in areas where the attenuation effect is not so significant. Write scripts to process 144 events recorded by 350 stations data and debug the inversion programs. The preliminary attenuation results imply that the lithosphere in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau has a stratified rheological structure with a weak mid-lower crust, probably caused by partial melting, on top of a strong uppermost mantle. (Oct 2019 – Present) 

***The relationship between Hutubi gas storage’s operation and the surrounding seismic activities.***

Utilized the Match-Filter technique to detect small earthquakes and expand the earthquake catalog. Wrote scripts to process the whole year continuous data of about 30 stations in 2016. Compared the seismicity before and after the completion of gas storage, found that the pressure of it has an enhanced influence on surrounding seismicity, especially the pressure increased beyond a certain threshold about 22MPa. (July 2018 – Oct 2019)

***Rupture process of the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake.***

Utilized the time-domain back-projection Method to investigate the rupture process of the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake, and found that crustal structure controlled the energy release of the earthquake. Wrote scripts based on MATLAB to process raw data recorded by USArray and realized the multi-channel cross-correlation algorithm to determine optimum relative delay times for seismograms. (Mar 2017 – Jun 2018)
